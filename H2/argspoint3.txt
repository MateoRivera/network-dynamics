Point b: 
The largest input rate that the system can handle without blowing up is proportional to the 

Now, the system will no longer adjust itself to meet all the demand; instead, each node will operate within the agreed time, regardless of the number of particles accumulated in it. This explains why, at node 0, the accumulation of particles continuously increasesâ€”the more particles enter the system, the more congestion occurs. Consequently, node 0 becomes a bottleneck in the system, representing the new capacity constraint.
